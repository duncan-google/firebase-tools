- Bump the Firebase Data Connect local toolkit to v1.6.1, which fixes the `OrderDirection` enum with `Optional` types in Dart codegen and adds `@ExperimentalFirebaseDataConnect` annotations in Kotlin codegen to avoid compiler warnings. (#7912)
- Added the appdistribution:group:list and appdistribution:testers:list commands.
